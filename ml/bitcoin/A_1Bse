1Bse is a Hong Kong exchange for trading Bitcoin and various altcoins with the Hong Kong Dollar, US Dollar, Euro, Singapore Dollar and Chinese Yuan.[1] The exchange refers to itself as the "Anonymous exchange" as it does not require a passport or ID from its users.[1] 1Bse also calls itself the "First Bitcoin Stock Exchange",[1] although it does not appear to offer stock options[2][3] and would not be the first service to do so if it did.[4]
