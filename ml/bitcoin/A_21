21 was founded in 2013 as 21e6, with the name being a reference to the controlled supply cap of the bitcoin economy.[1] In November, it was the subject of intense speculation after revealing $5 million in venture capital from a regulatory filing.[1] Co-founder Balaji Srinivasan stated that the startup's secrecy was "solely for pragmatic reasons – we didn’t have anything to say to the world,"[1] and they would not reveal their plans until May 2015.[5]
By March 2015, 21 raised over $100 million in venture capital from numerous investors including Qualcomm Inc.,[1][6][5] RRE Ventures,[1] Yuan Capital,[1] Cisco,[6][5] Andreessen Horowitz,[1] Khosla Ventures,[1] Data Collective,[1] PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel[1] and Max Levchin,[1] eBay Inc. co-founder Jeff Skoll,[1][5] Dropbox Inc.

Between 2013 and 2018 the company's main focus was on mining operations. In April 2018, co-founder Balaji Srinivasan, who became the CEO of a company in May 2015, announced that the company gradually reduced its mining operations and focused on building a new software to handle micropayments: the paid email and tasks product.[7]
