AgoraDesk is a peer-to-peer over-the-counter (P2P OTC) cryptocurrency exchange. It was created by the same team behind LocalMonero, Monero's equivalent of LocalBitcoins.[1]
Much like LocalBitcoins, AgoraDesk allows people from any country to use any payment method and any currency to trade Bitcoin. Every online trade has escrow protection, where the Bitcoin seller's funds will be escrowed until the end of the trade, which mitigates counterparty risk.
There are no KYC, AML, or identity verification requirements to use the service, and traders can choose any medium of exchange, including cash. AgoraDesk places a large emphasis on user privacy. An E-mail address is not required during registration. IP addresses are not associated with user accounts. AgoraDesk doesn't require the use of JavaScript to operate, completely mitigating the overwhelming majority of web vulnerabilities, which are dependent upon JavaScript. AgoraDesk also has a Tor portal and I2P portal.
AgoraDesk is the first platform to offer peer-to-peer over-the-counter derivatives trading, namely option contracts. [2] Options are a form of derivative contract, in which traders agree to exchange an asset at a preset price at a later date. 
Users can execute call and put options for risk hedging and leveraged trading, with physical settlement of underlying BTC. A similar setup was observed on the bitcoin-otc IRC channel with an inferior escrow setup, requiring both sides of the contract to be escrowed by a third party. On AgoraDesk, despite only the underlying asset being escrowed, counterparty risk is completely eliminated.[3]
